PART C: PROGRAMMINIG TECHNIQUE
Since I did this assignment alone I will respond to both questions:
After completing my design document and laying the foundation for the array2 struct, 
I encountered a significant challengeâ€”working with a new programming language. 
Although I had a clear understanding of the task at hand, the unfamiliarity of the language felt overwhelming.
To address this challenge effectively, I made a deliberate effort to enhance my coding efficiency for this assignment.
My approach involved better time management and breaking down the assignment into manageable components. Each day leading up to the due date, 
I focused on implementing a specific element of the assignment. As I look ahead, I'm committed to refining my naming conventions and simplifying my code. 
Additionally, I plan to adopt a strategy of breaking down programming assignments into smaller, more manageable problems as I know the assignments get more demanding as the semester goes on. 
This approach will allow me to concentrate on solving simpler tasks, gradually building up to tackle the larger issues.
