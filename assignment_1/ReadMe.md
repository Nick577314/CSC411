# Part C: Solving problems with fingerprint group

A practical visualization would be the University's student/faculty directory. our Fgroup program simply just stores each key and value pairs into a hashmap then prints out the names grouped by its key. How different is this to the name and last name for a student or faculty member organized by department or Degree. We can use this program as a building block to help organize groups of two trackable entities. whether that is a name and ID number or something similar. The above analogy is similar to the apropos command where you can type a `apropos keyword` or `apropos filetype`. Which prints out related content and commands related to the keyword and filetype.

I had no partner for this assignment. But I did collaborate and discuss the assignment with `aidan kelly`. Overall the entire assignment took me 5 to 6 hours because I found the documentation to be confusing and I got overwhelmed. `Fgroups` took longer than `Brightness`, becuase I never realized that I wasn't taking in input correctly. Which is my own fault for not reading the warnings at the bottom of the instructions. But both programs should be working as intended.
